To enable access to the tileserver, you will need to create a folder in your home directory called .holeshot
Place in it a file ~/.holeshot/holeshot.properties with the properties below.

The only required property is holeshot_tileservice_key which provides access to the tileserver imagery and metadata.

Currently there is no user database, so any name will work. It is used to correlate a user with their image viewing
activity in the experimental predictive caching module. Setting your username to "anonymous" or leaving the property
out will disable these analytics functions.

No data is collected outside your own deployment of holeshot, and it relies on the infrastructure you deploy to function
