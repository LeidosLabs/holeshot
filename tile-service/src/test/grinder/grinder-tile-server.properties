# The file name of the script to run.
# Relative paths are evaluated from the directory containing the properties file. The default is "grinder.py".
grinder.script = httpget.py
 
# The number of worker processes each agent should start. The default is 1.
grinder.processes = 15
 
# The number of worker threads each worker process should start. The default is 1.

# The number of runs each worker process will perform. When using the console this is usually set to 0, meaning
# "run until the console sends a stop or reset signal". The default is 1.

### Script sleep time ####
 
# The maximum time in milliseconds that each thread waits before starting. Unlike the sleep times specified in scripts, this is
# varied according to a flat random distribution. The actual sleep time will be a random value between 0 and the specified value.
# Affected by grinder.sleepTimeFactor, but not grinder.sleepTimeVariation. The default is 0ms.
grinder.initialSleepTime=20000
 
### Worker process control ###
 
# If set, the agent will ramp up the number of worker processes, starting the number specified every
# grinder.processesIncrementInterval milliseconds. The upper limit is set by grinder.processes. The default is to start all worker
# processes together.
grinder.processIncrement = 1
 
# Used in conjunction with grinder.processIncrement, this property sets the interval in milliseconds at which the agent starts new
# worker processes. The value is in milliseconds. The default is 60000 ms.
grinder.processIncrementInterval = 10000
