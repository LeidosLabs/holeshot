# Holeshot v0.2

---------------------------

## New Electronic Light Table (ELT) Capabilities

---------------------------
#### Mosaics
Launch multiple images into the same window, and they will be projected and displayed together.
#### Basemaps
Load base layers to display static reference content from a basemap service while projecting imagery tiles over it
#### Centos and OSX Compatibility
Launch and run the ELT service on multiple operating systems, in addition to Windows 10
#### New UI Features
Select interpolation modes and projection settings from within the ELT

---------------------------

## New Predictive Tile Analytics Module

---------------------------
A new module was introduced to allow Holeshot to cache images before they are ever requested
#### Automated collection and processing of tile access logs
Access logs are captured from the tileserver and processed offline (via EMR) along with other telemetry data to create a model of users' access patterns
#### Multi-tiered automated caching
Newly ingested image tiles that fall in hotspots will be cached in redis automatically. ELT Clients will pre-download imagery that falls in the users most frequently observed regions.
#### Serverless (SAM) deployments
The analytics module is completely serverless and easy to deploy and manage
#### New telemetry features in the ELT to support tile analytics
In addition to tile server logs, the ELT can send its tile access logs back to your holeshot deployment to track cache hits and improve the performance of predictive caching 

---------------------------

## Stability, Deployment, and General Enhancements

---------------------------
#### Improved Cloudformation Deployment
The cloudformation deployment was improved to allow multiple versions of the service to run inside the same VPC without interfering with each other.

#### Chipping Server Stability
The chipping server has improved stability and error handling which would cause instances to become unresponsive.

#### Image Ingest Stability
Bug fixes in the image ingest service to improve NITF header handling and general stability.

#### Optional JP2K Support
Bring your own driver support for JP2K decoding on image ingest
